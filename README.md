# Credit Risk Analysis and Modeling
It contains data on 1,000 loan applicants from a German bank, and the objective is to predict whether an applicant is a good or bad credit risk based on various attributes such as their credit history, employment status, and personal information.
The dataset has 9 input attributes such as credit history, purpose of the loan, personal status and sex, property status and housing type, employment status, age, and others, and one target attribute which is binary indicating whether the credit risk is good or bad.
The Statlog (German Credit Data) data set has been widely used for building models for risk analysis, credit scoring, and decision-making systems in banking and finance. Many classification algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks have been applied to this dataset, and it has become a standard benchmark for evaluating the performance of different models in the context of credit risk analysis
